# CS1230 Final Project by Vec3

## About

![scene](result.png)

We built a chirstmas themed scene for our final project. Our team implemented the following features:

- Parallax Mapping (Jazeps Medina Tretmanis)
- Shadow Mapping (Mohammed Khan)
- Particle Effects (Yuki Hayashita)

## Running the Project

To run our project, first open up the project in Qt using the `CMakeLists.txt` file. When you run the project you will see a UI pop up. On the UI you have the option to upload a scene file. Our scene file is located in the `resources/scene` folder, and is labelled `christmas.xml`. Once uploaded, you can toggle features on and off and see them on the screen in realtime. 

If nothing shows up after uploading the scene file, please try increasing the default FBO value through the UI.
